# Let's start to the very beginning ... the fundamentals

# Basic arithmetic operations
print(1 + 1)
print(2 - 1)
print(2 * 2)
print(4 / 2)

#Creating a variable
savings = 100
print(savings)

#_______________________________________________________________
#Here's a situation
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4


# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Add new_savings to your savings
total_savings = new_savings + savings

# Print total_savings
print("Your total savings are: ", total_savings)

#Here's another situation that tells you how to show the type of a variable
words = "Hello World"
numbers = 12345
floatNumbers = 123.45

print(type(words))
print(type(numbers))
print(type(floatNumbers))
